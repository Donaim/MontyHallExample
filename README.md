This is my example of Monty Hall Problem in haskell.  
Since I read about Monty Hall Problem in book  
 called "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"  
 I wondered why it is true that switching works.  
 This program is the attempt to explain that.  
Program also can be configured to handle multiple doors  
 and it is easy to experiment in different directions with it.
